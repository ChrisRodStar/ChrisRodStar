# Chris

Self-taught web developer. I like building clean, fast interfaces and figuring things out by breaking them first. Most of what I make ends up in **Next.js**, but I’m always experimenting across the stack.

- Currently diving into API design, full-stack workflows, and deployment  
- Tools I actually use: VS Code, Git/GitHub, Vercel, browser devtools
